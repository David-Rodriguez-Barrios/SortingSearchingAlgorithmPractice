# SortingSearchingAlgorithmPractice
In this project, I wanted to implement search and insertion algorithms utilizing template parameters to enable modular use of these algorithms for different data types indiscriminately. I integrated binary search and insertion sort about a vector template. 

## C++ Concepts
In this project, the data structure utilized is a vector utilizing heap. This class has a default constructor, a copy constructor, a destructor, and operator overloading to manipulate the class safely. I integrated different template and template specializations such as for characters and eventually expanded into string comparators. This will modularize the sorting so that it is compatible and easily utilizable.
